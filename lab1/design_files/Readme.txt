The hw and sw folders contain the design files for Parts I to V of the
exercise.

The demo.zip file contains:

part3: a working example solution for Part III
part4: a working example solution for Part IV
part5: a working example solution for Part V
part6: a working example of an extra animation that draws "lines"

lfsr_afu_unsigned.gbs: a green bitstream for the AFU that is used with the
above example solutions. You need to download this bitstream into the FPGA 
on a DevCloud machine with an Arria 10 PAC card in order to successfully 
run any of the demos.
