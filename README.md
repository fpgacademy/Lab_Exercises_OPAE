# OPAE laboratory exercises

The OPAE laboratory exercises begins with the development of a simple accelerator functional unit (AFU), which is a 
circuit in an FPGA that can be accessed by an Intel processor. Subsequent exercises in this set involve the 
development of more sophisticated AFUs that can be used to perform parts of a computation along with the processor.
